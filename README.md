# Untangling Force-Directed Layouts with Persistent Homology


## Abstract

Force-directed layouts belong to a popular class of methods used to position nodes in a node-link diagram. However, they typically lack direct consideration of global structures, which can result in visual clutter and the overlap of unrelated structures. In this work, we leverage persistent homology features of an undirected graph as derived information for interactive manipulation of force-directed layouts thus mitigating these issues. First, we devise a new method to use 0-dimensional persistent homology to efficiently generate an initial graph layout. The approach results in faster convergence and better quality graph layouts. We then use interactive persistence barcode to manipulate the force-directed graph layout by adding and removing contracting and repulsing forces generated by the 0-dimensional persistent homology features (i.e., components). Finally, we provide users the ability to interact with these 1-dimensional features (i.e., tunnels/cycles) by highlighting them and adding cycle-emphasizing forces to the layout.

## To run the demo:

To run properly, the code needs to be hosted on a webserver and loaded in a web browser. These instructions are for running a webserver locally with python. We have tested this setup on Mac, Linux, and Windows 11 distributions. 

### [required] Install python3

    On Debian linux, such as Ubuntu
    > sudo apt install python3

    On Mac, you can download from python.org, macports, or homebrew. You will need python3. 

    On Windows, you can download from python.org or the Windows Store.

### [required] Run the code

    Run the code (Mac/Linux)
    > ./run.sh
    
    Run the code (Windows)
    > Run run.bat
    
    Everything should be installed and the code will run. If everything goes as planned, a web browser will be opened automatically for you when everything is done. If it doesn't, you can open a web browser and go to http://localhost:5350/.
